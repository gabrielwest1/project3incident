NOTE: My initial idea for the container that holds the data might not be the best option but be sure to use either a 3 tuple or pair for the vectors in order 
to be able to use the quick sort and merge sort functions

-finding top 5(not including ties) most frequent non-chain resturant in specific state USE SORTS --> after selecting option give option to to use quick or merge sort
-finding top 5(not including ties) most frequent chain resturant in specific states USE SORTS --> after selecting option give option to to use quick or merge sort
-list top 10 most frequent chain resturants in US(not including ties) USE SORTS --> after selecting option give option to to use quick or merge sort
-list top 10 most frequent non chain resturant in US(not including ties) USE SORTS --> after selecting option give option to to use quick or merge sort
-What state is a certain resturant the most frequent in. --> straight forward dont use sorts for this




NOTE: need to compare time program takes to execute with mergesort and quicksort be sure to also include all 3 parts of the csv file.
